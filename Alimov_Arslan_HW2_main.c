* Description:
	This assignment our main function receives arguments 
	this arguments contain our First name Last name and 		
    some message. Then those arguments fill out our 	
    personal information after which we write it into our 		
    buffer till we get empty line

/*
MAIN COMMENTS / My Thoughts and Logic doing this assignment
To simply describe the logic of this file - I am creating commandline that is taking two parameters list of arguments and counter to count them.
I then create all my variables (because the code looks cleaner that way.
I decided to allocate memory using malloc instead of just creating an array of size 256 buffer[256] ,because it is proper way of creating buffer. As well as it creates buffer based on the real size of your variable/object.
I then  check for buffers if they are NULL so if they don't have anything inside them(they didn't get allocated) I write something that will state the error and exit the code with int 1.
I then start to fillout my aboutme object which is basically struct from personalInfo , I found out that if I just do aboutme->message = arguments[3] , it does not really copy whole message
so I had to use strcpy which copied all of my messages. Then I call a function writeperseonalInfo passing my about me information as a parameter (this is what the assignment is asking for).
I decided to create a constant char which stores my nextline. It is a way for me to controll my nextlines because if I were to call getNext(); each time it would be new line each time
but this way I actually store nextline somewhere.
I use whole loop which basically checks for NULL value in the nextline if its empty , this is used for our cmd line to continue working otherwise it would stop.
inside while loop I used for loop which checks for the last character inside our next string in C our last character in string is always \0 <- we went over that in class.
I then fillout my buffer and use my iterator which is 0 and do +1 inside the loop while our nextline does not get to \0 empty character. I use different counters , because one will be controlled iterator
and another one is not controlled which is i ,we use i in order to get all lines.
I then use if statement to check if buffer size equals to 256  , I flush out my buffer  set memory of my buffer back to 0 and the size of buffer 256.
and I set my iterator for buffer to 0.
I used nextstring = getNext(); because that way our cmd line not going to look for input from us and will continue working untill it gets to NULL.
I check for my iterator if it does not equal to 0 then I call commitblock again to flush out my memory this is more like for safety of my buffer.
I set my pointers to NULL and I free them to not have any dangling pointers e.t.c.
Lastly I call checkit() to make sure everything is properly allocated and works.
return 0 as a sucessful run
